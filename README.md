# Stock-Taking System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based stock-taking system designed to manage inventory, track sales, and compute revenue for a bar or any other type of business that sells drinks. The system allows users to:
- Add new stock items (drinks) with predefined prices.
- Track daily stock levels by carrying over remaining stock from the previous day.
- Record sales and compute the revenue based on the sales quantity and item prices.
- Prevent adding duplicate items to the stock inventory.
- Carry forward the stock for the next day automatically.

## Features

   - Prevent duplicate items from being added.
   - Predefined item prices for automatic cash computation based on sales.

2. **Stock Records:**
   - Track daily stock levels: Old Stock, Current Stock, and New Stock.
   - Automatically calculate sales based on stock usage.
   - Automatically calculate cash based on item prices and sales quantity.

3. **Daily Carry Forward:**
   - Automatically carry forward the remaining stock to the next dayâ€™s old stock.

4. **User Authentication:**
   - User login functionality using Flask-Login for authentication.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using Flask-Bcrypt.
